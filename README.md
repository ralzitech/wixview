# WixView!
*Making Wix websites a breeze*

## What is WixView?
WixView is essentially an HTML wrapper for Wix websites that removes the annoying "This website was created with Wix" banner. You can also redirect your own domains here with CNAME and DNS records too! 

## Does it really work?
**[Yes, it does!](https://ralzitech.github.io)** - WixView works by setting the margin limit to a limit that Wix cannot render anymore, which as a result, removes the Wix banner! Here's an example:

## Isnt that against Wix TOS though?
As far as I'm concerned, it is not against Wix TOS; iFrames are something that Wix allows both in and outside of its editor, so you don't need to worry about your site getting removed for using it!

## How hard is it to set up?
Setting up WixView is as easy as 1, 2, 3! - just insert your Wix website inside the iFrame and upload it to your hosting provider! It's really that simple!

## Okay, I'm hooked. How do I get started?
[You can download WixView from the Releases area!](https://github.com/ralzitech/wixview/releases)
