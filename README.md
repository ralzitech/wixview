# WixView!
*Making Wix websites a breeze*

## What is WixView?
WixView is essentially an HTML wrapper for Wix websites that removes the annoying "This website was created with Wix" banner. You can also redirect your own domains here with CNAME and DNS records too! 

## Does it really work?
**Yes, it does!** - WixView works by setting the margin limit to something crazy, which as a result, removes the Wix banner! Here's an example!

## Setup
Setting up WixView is as easy as 1, 2, 3! - just insert your Wix website inside the iFrame and upload it to your hosting provider! It's really that simple!

## Downloads
[You can download WixView from the Releases area!](https://github.com/ralzitech/wixview/releases)
